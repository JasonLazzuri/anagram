## Specifications

* First it will check if the words have vowels to make sure they are words;
  Example: "xmtn xmtl"
  Output: "That is not a real word!"

* It will then check if words are anagrams or not, regardless of capitalization.
 Example: "ruby bury" or "ruby Bury"
 Output: "These words are anagrams"

* It will also check if a word is an anagram it will also check whether or not they are palindromes
 Example: "racecar racecar"
